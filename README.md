## Executive Summary 
- ***Introduction***:  My project for 6443's Something Awesome is playing as many CTFs as I can. I will find CTFs via CTFTime each week and solve challenges in each CTFs. The reasons why I chose playing CTFs as 6443's Something Awesome are because I enjoy playing CTFs and they help improving my security knowledge and skills 
-   ***Initial goals***: 
	- Play at least **5 CTFs during 5 weeks** (from week 06 to week 10).
